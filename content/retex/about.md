Hi ! 👋  
I'm Nathanaël , a French cybersecurity student at [ESGI Lyon](https://www.esgi.fr/). I currently work at HYGGLE where i do pentest and infra security. I am passionate about Web, Cloud, Infrastructure.

I chose to create this blog to share my little experience in cybersecurity also write articles for better understanding various concepts . Moreover I wan't to improve my english skill which is why all posts are written in english , however if you are french and you want to discuss more about writeups / article you can contact me on Linkedin or Discord.
